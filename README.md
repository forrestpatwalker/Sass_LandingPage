# About
This is a repo is for a basic landing page built using HTML and Sass. 

The primary purpose is for me to learn Sass and to showcase my progress doing so.

Here is a screenshot of what the landing page looks like. I know it would be better to have an actual hosted site for this but since this is primarily a learning expierence for Sass there is really no functionality to the landing page. I do plan to build some fully functional sites with Sass and will link to them here when I do.

## Notes
Typically it is not necessary to have the scss files uploaded to a repo as you really only need the generated css file however, since this repo is primarily for learning purposes I thought it would be best to keep them here.
